    "# NOMIS API Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after this paper was accepted, I received a very helpful reply from NOMIS relating to the fact that I couldn't seem to get their API helper to give me the query needed to retrieve each of the data sets used in this research directly (which would make replication much, much faster and easier). I've not had time to refactor the code to incorporate their guidance but here is an overview of the process that will need to be followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select your dataset\n",
    "* Select only the region in your query and not the LSOAs - so in the case of your query, choose the \"London\" region as an individual selection (not using \"areas within\").\n",
    "* Continue to select other options to build up your query as normal\n",
    "* Select the \"Nomis API\" download format and you should get the page with the API links (ignore the first tab and go to the \"Complete list of API links\" page to get the URL)\n",
    "* When you get the URL, modify it as in the example below\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of modifying the URL is below, the change involves simply telling the API you want all LSOAs in the area you have selected, you do this by adding the text \"TYPE304\" (which is the code for 2001 LSOAs) to the geography code. The code for 2011 LSOAs is TYPE298.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original URL for the query London region:\n",
    "http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/api/v01/dataset/NM_1673_1.bulk.csv?date=latest&geography=2013265927&dwelling_type=0,3...5,7...9&measures=20100\n",
    "\n",
    "Modified URL for the query selecting all LSOAs in London region:\n",
    "http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/api/v01/dataset/NM_1673_1.bulk.csv?date=latest&geography=2013265927TYPE304&dwelling_type=0,3...5,7...9&measures=20100\n"
